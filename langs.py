Hi {name}! 👋

📅 I'm @srnmSchoolBot for scheduling your school *lessons* and reminding you about your *school tasks*

📝 I should be added into your Telegram *class chat* to be able to send you messages about your *lessons*

📌 For more info try /help
            """,
        'help':
            """
🌎 First of all, go to /settings and choose your language if exists!

🤔 To use @srnmSchoolBot you should go with /class command

📃 If you had already created at least one class, just choose it from the list (or create a new one)
➕ Otherwise, you will be given an opportunity to create one. Enter the name of your new class

💭 After that you should add @srnmSchoolBot into your Telegram class chat
✅ Then write /verify to connect your class and the bot (note that you should be an *administrator* in this chat)

⏩ Now you're done! You can go with /class command again and choose your class
⚙ Go to settings at first! Here choose if you want to be notified about the lessons, choose the timezone of your class to be notified in the correct time and then you have to set notification time
👨‍💻 You can also add another administrator, for example, if you want someone to help you in editing the schedule (note that new administrators can delete other admins)
👉 To choose language for your class, just press the button

❌ You can delete whole class with all groups and lessons, you can change class name

📍 To use scheduling feature, create at least one group. You can also delete it with all the lessons or change its name

🗓 Now you can edit timetable!
👉 Go to the day you want your new lesson to be and press the button to add a lesson
📚 Input info about your lesson: name (ex. Math), start time (ex. 9hrs 30mins), duration (ex. 45mins), homework (not necessary, ex. Task 5 p. 11), place (not necessary, ex. Room 214 or Caroline College Center)
🔜 All this info will be displayed, when you would be notified about the lesson. You can also put weekly parameter on if your lesson is held every week. With that type of lessons you can't change their time for future lessons
🌐 You can also add the lesson for all groups. The duplicates of the lesson will be created for each group in your class

↪ When you are done with scheduling your lessons, you can go to your Telegram class chat and go with /class command again, choose the desired group and choose the lesson you want to know info about
✅ You will be also notified about the lessons in your chat if you put notification parameter on in settings
